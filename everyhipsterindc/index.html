        <p><a href='http://everybarindc.com/'>Every Bar in DC</a> is a ridiculous 'DC'
        'blog' about 'bars', but it's
        also about complaining about hipsters. Without going into the moronic, overplayed
        subject itself<a href='#' id='okay' />...</a>, here's just the blog distilled.</p>
        <table id='t'>
        </table>
        <small>if you want to go into the moronic, overplayed subject itself, the trick is
          to look for the inverse - who are the people who are <em>not described as hipsters?</em>
          everybarindc seems to think these are mainly either 'residents of the surrounding area',
          'young professionals', people who like sports, and beer lovers - which neatly define
          hipsters in the inverse, though it's hard to invert 'beer lovers' when talking about
          people who are at a bar.</small>
